# Concentino 

Concentino is media player to rival Itunes.

Currently runs with:

- Angular v6.1.2
- Electron v2.0.7
- Electron Builder v20.28.1

Install dependencies with npm :

``` bash
npm install
```

There is an issue with `yarn` and `node_modules` that are only used in electron on the backend when the application is built by the packager. Please use `npm` as dependencies manager.
